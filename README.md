## Dynamic Football Stats

This repository was created to generate valuable insights from football data. While the current dataset is static, taken from the 2023/24 Serie A League, the project is designed to be dynamic and could easily integrate data from the current season through an API.

In addition to the insights, a quick and interactive "quiz" feature was developed.

The data were taken from an open-source repository (https://github.com/openfootball/football.json/tree/master).

The real objective of the repository was to test actual capabilities of Cursor and Vercel (sorry for the bad documentation).
